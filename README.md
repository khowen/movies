#My Movies
###<https://nameless-crag-9310.herokuapp.com/>

###Description:
The goal of this project was to develop a fully restful, CRUD based Rails app from scratch without the use of scaffolding.
I successfully completed these requirements, and I added some additional functionalities such as searching for a film through the omdb api, and auto populating the form with the data.
In addition, I used the Devise gem to experiment with user authorization and authentication.

For the design of this app, I really wanted to work with Materialize Css, and in doing so, I did end up straying from my original mockups to experiment with some of the frameworks added functionalities.
I did stay true to my original color scheme of a rich purple and bold lime!
