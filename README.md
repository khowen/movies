###Description
The goal of this project was to develop a fully restful, CRUD based Rails app from scratch without the use of scaffolding. I successfully completed these requirements, and I added some additional functionalities such as searching for a film through the omdb api, and auto populating the form with the data. In addition, I used the Devise gem to experiment with user authorization and authentication.
